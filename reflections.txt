# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?

I used 'terminal-table'. It neatly formats the output in the terminal console into a table.

2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) Feature 1:  Delete multiple indexes
        I allowed the delete method to accept multiple arguments ( def delete(*args))
        then refactored the delete method, based on a little stackoverflow reading
          @items.delete_if.with_index { |_, index| args.include? index +1 }
        this is iterating through the items array and deleting the item from the array if the index of that item is in the args array
        we haven't explored the underscore variable, much yet - I'm not sure what it references. It seems to be mainly be used by ruby
        internally to prohibit duplicate references. I don't use the underscore variable. This seemed to be the
        most succint solution, if a little mysterious. My other attempts (involving making a copy of either the items), weren't effective.

        usage
        list.delete(2,3) ... with any number of arguments. will throw errors if any argument is invalid

  b) Feature 2: Change priority of items
        Events are allowed to change priority to "high", "medium", or "low" only.
        In appropriate cases errors are thrown:
            If item is not an event: InvalidItemType
            If priority is not "high", "medium" or "low": InvalidPriorityValue


# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project? 2 days
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered? create Gemfile and Gemfile.lock
3. What two additional features did you build? Why? Change prioriy, Delete multiple indexes.  (see above)
4. Where do you still have room to grow? Learning to find and use the most appropriate gems. Ruby seems
    to be a very tradesmen-like language. Rather than learning how to code algorithmically, it is more useful
    to find and use the appropriate gems effectively.
